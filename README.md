# RPN-Calculator:

### About this project: 

This is  a first  try of my to create a  open source program, and I got inspiration from a task that I had done at college.

This is a basic  calculator based on **Reverse Polish Notation** (RPN) mode or simply  **postfix notation**, and it means that  which operators follow their operands. 

In this mathematical notation, for example, to add  6 and 7 ,  would write  6 7 +,  instead of 6 + 7. In the situation that you have more than one operation you could do the following: 

**Conventional way:** 6 + 7 - 2, that results in 11

**RPN notation:** 6 7 + 2 - (first 6 and 7 will be added together and then will be subtracted from 2), also result in 11; Or 6 7 2 - + (first 7 will be subtracted from 2 and then added  6), also results in 11.

Another  useful example:

**Conventional way:** 6 + 7 * 2 or 6  + (7 * 2) that results in 20. Although, it would be quite different if it was written (6 + 7) * 2 that results in 26.

**RPN notation:** 6 7 2 * +, result in 20. Or 6  7 + 2 * that result in 26



## Why?

The reason why I decided to do this is because I want to create a portfolio and I thought that it might been a good idea to start with this one. It would  help me to learn the basic concepts of Git and GitHub. Also, I would like to show my current ability with programming and improvements that will happen.

Nevertheless, I would like to you to keep in contact to tell me what did you think about this project and with you have any suggestions.

## Observation:

1 - This calculator does not make decimal math operations, the results need to be in the Natural Numbers. If this won't happen the result will be rounded.

2- For this project, the user can not type the numbers, the only way to put the numbers into the input section is by clicking the buttons disposed;
